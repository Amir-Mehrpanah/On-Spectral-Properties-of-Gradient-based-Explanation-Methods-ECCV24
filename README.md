# On Spectral Properties of Gradient-based Explanation Methods (published in ECCV24)

This repository is used to reproduce all experiments discussed in our paper.

We are in the process of refactoring this code for our next work please use the Berzelius branch which is up to date. Also note that unfortunately on Berzelius branch we assume you are using Berzelius so you might have to change some parts of the code. 

Please refer to the [paper](#) for more details (I'll update the link as soon as the the public version of the papers are out).
